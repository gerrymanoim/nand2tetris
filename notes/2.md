# Project 2 Notes 

$N$ bits => $2^N$ possibilities. 

Maximual value represented by k bits: $2^{k-1}$, $\sum_{i=0}^{n}b_{i}\cdot 2^{i}$.

## Hardware

Half adder - adds two bits, returns sum + carry
Full adder - adds three bits, returns sum + carry
Adder: adds two n-bi numbers
Multi-bit adder - adds two 16 bit twos compilement values,

## Negative numbers

Don't scarifice a bit + ambiguity by just using a bit for sign. 

Two's compliment. We represent $-x$ by using $2^{n}-x$. You get numbers in the range $[-2^{n-1}, 2^{n-1}-1]$

For representation in the two's compilment $x+(-x)=2^{n}$.

All positive number codes begin with 0. 

All negative number codes begin with 1. 

To go from x to -x, flip all the bits of x and add 1 to the result.
