Stored Program concept - logic of programs is not embedded in the hardware. Program is just like data.

Memory stores the data and the program being executed.

CPU loop (fetch-execute cycle):

1. Decode the current instruction
2. execute it
3. figure out next instruction to execute
4. fetch it
5. go to 1

## Regiesters

We use them to speed up data access for the ALU/CPU

- Data Registers: short term temp variable storage
- Address registers: storage for computed addresses
- Program Counter: keeps track of the next instruction to fetch

## Memory mapped I/O

I/O devices look to the computer like regular sections of memory
