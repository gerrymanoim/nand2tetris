# Chapter 7 - Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic

To compile we take high level code and translate it to intermediate code that can run on a virtual machine. This code will then get converted into machine language. This helps with cross platform - the machine langauge and the high level langauge are separated from eachother. Also allows different langauges to compile down to the same VM, helping with codesharing.

In VM langauge we have four types of commands:

1. Arithmetic and logical operations on stack
2. Memory access: Transfers data between stack and virtual memory
3. Program Flow: conditional/unconditional branching
4. Subroutines: call functions and return from them

## Stacks as a data structure

LIFO Queues.

- Push: put on top of stack
- Pop: take from top of stack

We implement by keeping an array (i.e. the stack) and a pointer variable (`sp`) that points to the location just above the top of the stack. Thus `push x` means `stack[sp]=x;sp=sp+1` and `pop x` is `sp=sp-1; return stack[sp]`.

To perform arithmetic:

- pop required data from the stack
- perform operation
- push result on to stack

## Program command structure

file with a `.vm` extension, with one or more fuctnons.

Three forms of commands:
1. No args `add`
2. command arg `goto loop`
3. command arg1 arg2 `push local 3`

Sepraration is arbitrary number of spaces
`//` comments can be at end of line
Blanks permitted and ignored

## A reminder of the Hack Code

**A Instruction**: `@value` where `value is either:
1. A non-negative decimal constant
2. A symbol referring to such a constant

Semantics:
- sets A register to `value`
- Make `M` the `RAM` location whose address is `value`, i.e. `M=RAM[A]`

**C Instruction**: `dest = comp ; jump`

Semantics:
- computes the value of comp and stores the result in `dest`.
- if `(comp jump 0)` is true, jumps to execute instruction in `ROM[A]`
