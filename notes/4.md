# Project 4 Notes

Model of memory: a continuous array of cells with fixed width (words or locations) with a unique address.

> Memory[address], RAM[address], M[address]

Registers - like memory, but on the CPU. Much faster. 

In Hack we have `D`, `A`, `M` registers

D - only data values. 
A - data and address register
    - `M` always refers to the memory word whose address is the current value of the A register. `M` is really `Memory[A]`
    - Any jump operation always effects a jump to the instruction located in the meory word `A`
    - @value will trhow something into `A`

Hack language is actually two instructions:

- A-instruction: address instruction
  - `@value` number of symbol
- C-instruction: compute instruction
  - `dest=comp;jump` where `dest` and `jump` can be empty
  -
