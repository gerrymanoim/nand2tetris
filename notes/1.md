# Project 1 Notes

## Fundamental Theorems

Any boolean function can be represented using an expression containing `Nand` operations only. 

`Nand` is defined as:

```
(x Nand y) = Not(x And y)
```

## HDL Notes

- Order is not important 
- language is functional/declaritive
- busses (which are a collection of bits) are indexed from _right to left_. Thus for `foo[16]`, `foo[0]` is the rightmost bit and `foo[15]` is the left most. 

## Boolean Identities

- Commutative Laws
  - `(x And y) = (y And x)`
  - `(x Or y) = (y Or x)`
- Associative Laws
  - `(x And (y And z)) = ((x And y) And z)`
  - `(x Or (y Or z))=((x Or y) Or z)`
- Distributive Laws
  - `(x And (y Or z)) = (x And y) Or (x And z)`
  - `(x Or (y And z)) = (x Or y) And (x Or z)`
- De Morgan Laws
  - `Not(x And y) = Not(x) Or Not(y)`
  - `Not(x Or y) = Not(x) And Not(y)`

## Standard Gates

We are given `Nand`. We need to build the following:

**Elemetary Logic Gates**

- Not
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Mux
- DMux

**16 Bit variants**

- Not16
- And16
- Or16
- Mux16

**Multi-way variants**

- Or8Way
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way
