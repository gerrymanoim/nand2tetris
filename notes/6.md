# Chapter 6 - Assembler

Assembly code = `.asm` => Machine code (binary) = `.hack`

`.hack` files - 16 characters per line - 0/1

`.asm` files - each line is an instruction or symbol declation

- instruction - A or c instruction
- `(symbol)` - bind the symbol to a memory location

In `asm` files we have:

- constants and symbols
  - costants: non negative decimals
  - symbol - any sequence of letters, digits, ), ., $, : that does not begin with a digit
- Comments `//`
- white space - ignored
- Case convention - all assembly mneumonics must be upper case. Labels + var names are case sensitive
  - we tend to use upper case for labels, lower case for var anmes

## Instructions

- A-instruction: `@value`
  - `value` is either a non-negative decimal number or symbol refering to such a number
  - Binary `0vvv vvvv vvvv vvvv` where each `v` is 0 or 1
- C-instruction: `dest=comp;jump`
  - `dest` and `jump` may be empty
    - if `dest` is empty, no `=`
    - if `jump` is empty, no `;`
  - Binary: `111a c1c2c3c4 c5c6d1d2 d3j1j2j3`
    - see tables for translation specification

## Symbols

Symbols come from:

1. Predefined symbols - see table
2. Label symbols `(symbol)`. A label can be defined only once and can be used anywhere in the asssembly program - even before the line in which it was defined.
3. Variable symbols - symbol not fitting the other two categories. Variables are mapped to consecutive memory locations as encountered, starting at RAM 16 (0x0010).

## Implementation

We want to build:

1. Parser class - parses the input
2. Code class - provides the binary codes for the assembly mnemonics
   1. dest (3)
   2. comp (7)
   3. jump (3)
3. Symbol Table - class that handles symbols
4. Main program - drives translation process
5.
